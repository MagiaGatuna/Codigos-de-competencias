Johan constantly receives questions about how yummy a food is. He figured a way to encode all the ingredients of a particular dish in a string in such a way that when the number of "Yu" found in the string are bigger than the number of characters in the string (without the "Yu") divided by 2, then that food is considered yummy. Your task is to help Johan to automate this task for any given string.

Input
A single string of size N (0<Nâ‰¤210
).

Output
For each string print "Yummy" if the condition from Johan is met otherwise print "Not so Yummy".
